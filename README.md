# Menu-Assortment


With the prosperity of sharing economy, more part-time and freelance suppliers (i.e.,~drivers) join on-demand mobility services. Because of suppliers' autonomy and behavioural heterogeneity, the operation platform cannot ensure that suppliers will accept a dispatch order. One approach to mitigate this supply uncertainty is to provide suppliers with personalized menus of dispatching recommendations. A key issue then is to determine which dispatch orders (that can be passenger or goods services) should be allocated to the assortment menu of each supplier. This paper probabilistically models the suppliers' order acceptance and choice behaviour, including a \emph{decline} option. We propose two assortment optimization problems to maximize the expected number of matches, disjoint and joint menus. We show that the objective function of the disjoint menu assortment problem is monotone non-decreasing submodular. In contrast, the objective function of the joint menu assortment problem is non-monotone and non-submodular. Accordingly,  we present standard greedy (SG) and local search (LS) algorithms to solve the disjoint and joint assortment problems, respectively. A case study is presented based on the real-world demand in Manhattan road network. The numerical results show that the proposed dispatch menus could improve the platforms' efficiency and simultaneously enhance drivers' and customers' experiences.
